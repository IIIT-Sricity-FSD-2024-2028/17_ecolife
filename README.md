# Problem Statement : __Resource usage and impact analytics platform__


Individuals and organizations face significant challenges in monitoring and managing their consumption of resources like electricity, water, gas, and fuel across homes, facilities, and departments. The lack of an integrated tracking and analytics system leads to:

* **Lack of visibility into resource usage:** Consumers and departments cannot see their usage patterns, making it impossible to identify waste, compare consumption over time, or understand what drives high bills
* **Delayed problem detection:** Operations teams lack real-time monitoring and alerts, resulting in undetected leaks, equipment failures, and abnormal consumption spikes that waste resources and increase costs
* **Unmeasured environmental impact:** Sustainability-focused individuals and leaders cannot calculate their carbon footprint, set realistic reduction targets, or demonstrate progress toward environmental commitments

This platform aims to provide comprehensive consumption tracking, real-time alerting, environmental impact calculations, and intuitive dashboards and reports that empower everyone—from individual households to large organizations—to conserve resources, reduce costs, and achieve their sustainability goals.

# Identified Actors

The system supports four primary user roles:

* **Resource User:** Individuals or department members who consume electricity, water, gas, and fuel, and need to track their usage to reduce waste and costs.

* **Operations Manager:** Facility managers responsible for monitoring consumption, detecting problems like leaks or equipment failures, analyzing trends, and configuring alerts.

* **Sustainability Manager:** Environmental officers who calculate carbon footprints, set reduction targets, track environmental progress, and generate sustainability reports.

* **System Administrator:** IT staff responsible for managing user accounts, configuring the platform, and ensuring reliable system operations.

# Actor Features
