- **List key terms used by the domain expert and their meanings :**

| Term | Meaning as explained by the expert |
|---|---|
| Resource User | An individual or department member who consumes resources and tracks consumption to identify waste and reduce costs |
| Operations Manager | Facility manager or operations coordinator responsible for monitoring consumption, detecting anomalies, and configuring alerts |
| Sustainability Manager | Environmental officer or sustainability director who measures carbon footprint, establishes targets, and reports on sustainability performance |
| System Administrator | IT professional responsible for managing user accounts, configuring system parameters, and ensuring platform reliability |
| Resource Consumption | Measured quantity of electricity, water, gas, or fuel used over a specific time period |
| Usage Alert | Notification generated when consumption exceeds thresholds or exhibits unusual patterns |
| Carbon Footprint | Total greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2 equivalents from resource consumption activities |
| Sustainability Target | Measurable goal to reduce consumption, lower emissions, or improve environmental performance |
| Emission Factor | Standard coefficient converting resource consumption quantities into equivalent CO2 emissions |
| Sustainability Report | Document summarizing environmental performance, emissions, and progress toward reduction targets |

## Actors and Responsibilities

| Actor / Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| **Resource User** | Submits resource usage data, views personal usage dashboard, receives usage alerts, and acts on insights to conserve resources |
| **Operations Manager** | Monitors real-time consumption, analyzes trends, configures alert thresholds, and responds to operational issues like leaks or equipment failures |
| **Sustainability Manager** | Reviews environmental impact assessments, sets sustainability targets, generates reports for stakeholders, and tracks progress toward goals |
| **System Administrator** | Manages user accounts and permissions, configures system settings, and maintains platform integrations with smart meters and external data sources |

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Resource Usage Data Collection and Personal Monitoring

**Trigger / Start Condition**  
Resource User consumes utilities in daily operations.

**Steps Involved**
1. User logs into the platform.
2. Usage data is captured (manual entry, smart meters, or bill upload).
3. System validates and stores the data.
4. Personal usage dashboard is updated with trends and comparisons.
5. If usage exceeds thresholds, system generates alerts.
6. User receives notifications and reviews consumption patterns.

**Outcome / End Condition**  
Usage data is recorded, user has visibility into consumption, and is alerted to anomalies.

---

### Workflow 2: Real-time Consumption Monitoring and Problem Detection

**Trigger / Start Condition**  
Operations Manager needs to monitor organizational resource consumption.

**Steps Involved**
1. Manager accesses real-time monitoring dashboard.
2. System displays current consumption across facilities/departments.
3. Manager analyzes trends and identifies anomalies.
4. System automatically flags issues (leaks, equipment failures).
5. Manager receives real-time alerts for critical situations.
6. Manager configures or adjusts alert thresholds.
7. Corrective actions are initiated.

**Outcome / End Condition**  
Operational issues detected quickly, thresholds optimized, comprehensive understanding of consumption patterns.

### Workflow 3: Environmental Impact Assessment and Sustainability Reporting

**Trigger / Start Condition**  
Sustainability Manager needs to calculate carbon footprint and generate reports.

**Steps Involved**
1. Manager logs into platform and selects reporting scope.
2. System retrieves resource usage data.
3. Platform fetches emission factors from database.
4. System calculates environmental impact metrics (carbon footprint).
5. Manager reviews results and compares against sustainability targets.
6. Manager sets or updates sustainability targets.
7. System tracks progress against targets.
8. Manager generates sustainability reports formatted per required frameworks.
9. Reports exported for stakeholders and regulatory bodies.

**Outcome / End Condition**  
Environmental impact quantified, targets tracked, and reports available for all stakeholders.

## Rules, Constraints, and Exceptions

### Mandatory Rules or Policies
- All resource usage data must include accurate units and timestamps.
- Environmental impact calculations must use standardized emission factors.
- Sustainability targets must be measurable and time-bound.
- Data submission must be validated for accuracy.

### Constraints or Limitations
- Real-time monitoring requires smart meter integration (not available everywhere).
- Historical baseline data may not exist for new facilities.
- Emission factors vary by geographic region.
- Manual data entry subject to delays and errors.

### Common Exceptions or Edge Cases
- Data submitted with incorrect units requiring conversion.
- Seasonal variations causing legitimate consumption spikes.
- Facility renovations causing step-changes in consumption.
- Missing emission factors for specialized resource types.

### Situations Where Things Usually Go Wrong
- Manual data entry errors preventing accurate pattern detection.
- Alert thresholds set too high, missing early problem detection.
- Outdated emission factors causing inaccurate carbon calculations.
- Alert fatigue from overly sensitive thresholds.

---

## Current Challenges and Pain Points

- Manual data collection is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Integrating diverse smart meters and utility APIs is complex.
- Maintaining accurate emission factors across regions requires constant updates.

## Assumptions & Clarifications

### Assumptions Confirmed
- Platform must serve both households and large organizations.
- Real-time monitoring essential for detecting leaks and failures.
- Carbon footprint calculation is core requirement.
- Domain expert validated the proposed actors and use cases.

### Assumptions Corrected
- Platform serves individual households, not just organizations.
- Sustainability reporting increasingly expected quarterly, not just annually.
- Alerts use statistical anomaly detection, not just threshold violations.

### Open Questions Needing Follow-Up
- How often should users submit their consumption data?
- What is the preferred format for exporting sustainability reports?
- How long should historical consumption data be retained?
- Should alerts be sent via SMS, email, or both?
- Should the platform include educational tips for reducing consumption?
