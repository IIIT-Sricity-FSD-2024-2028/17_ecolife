  - name: Resource Consumption
    definition: The measured quantity of electricity, water, gas, or fuel used by an individual, department, or facility over a specific time period.
    examples:
      - "Our office consumed 12,500 kWh of electricity last month"
      - "The manufacturing plant used 50,000 liters of water this week"
    aliases:
      - Usage Data
      - Consumptio nRecord

  - name: Usage Alert
    definition: A notification is generated when resource consumption exceeds predefined thresholds or exhibits unusual patterns, indicating potential leaks, equipment failures, or wasteful practices.
    examples:
      - "I received an alert that Building A's water usage spiked by 200% overnight"
      - "The system sent me a notification that we exceeded our monthly electricity threshold"
    aliases:
      - Consumption Alert
      - Threshold Notification

  - name: Carbon Footprint
    definition: The total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, measured in carbon dioxide equivalents, generated from resource consumption activities over a specific period.
    examples:
      - "Our company's carbon footprint was 150 tons of CO2 last quarter"
      - "My household generated 2.5 tons of CO2 from electricity usage this year"
    aliases:

      - Emission Footprint

  - name: Sustainability Target
    definition: A measurable goal established to reduce resource consumption, lower carbon emissions, or improve environmental performance within a specified time period.
    examples:
      - "We've set a target to reduce electricity consumption by 15% by year-end"
      - "Our goal is to achieve a 25% reduction in carbon emissions within two years"
    aliases:
      - Reduction Goal
      - Environmental Objective

  - name: Emission Factor
    definition: A standard coefficient used to convert resource consumption quantities into equivalent carbon dioxide emissions, based on the type of resource and regional energy mix.
    examples:
      - "The emission factor for our region's grid electricity is 0.85 kg CO2 per kWh"
      - "Natural gas has an emission factor of 2.0 kg CO2 per cubic meter"
    aliases:
      - Conversion Factor
      - Carbon Coefficient


  - name: Sustainability Report
    definition: A document that summarizes environmental performance, carbon emissions, and progress toward reduction targets for individuals and department members.
